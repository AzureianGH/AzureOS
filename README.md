# AzureOS
My Operating System (AzureOS) Bootloader built off https://dev.to/frosnerd/writing-my-own-boot-loader-3mld

## HOW TO BUILD
Inside of OSBUILDTOOLS/ is a file named "azosbt.sh"
Run this file with parameters --help to get all build options.
Run without params to build normally, and run with --run-vm to use qemu.
